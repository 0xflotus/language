# Work In Progress

This repository is primarily a place for the Dart language team to work on
language changes and features, and to solicit and accept feedback and requests.
The repository is still in an experimental stage, so expect changes to the
organization and processes documented here.

Issues and feature requests relevant to the language and the specification may
be filed [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues).

# Organization

We follow
roughly
[this process](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/doc/life_of_a_language_feature.md) for
planning and rolling out language changes.

Notes from language design meetings can be
found [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/minutes/).
